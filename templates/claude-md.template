THIS FILE IS BINDING.

This is a Next.js App Router storefront generated by screenshop (github.com/willblack2006/screenshop).

ALLOWED:
- Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Shopify Storefront API (GraphQL only via src/lib/shopify.ts)

FORBIDDEN:
- Stripe, Firebase, Supabase, Prisma, MongoDB
- Shopify Admin API or REST APIs
- Auth providers, databases, payment logic

SHOPIFY RULES:
- All Shopify calls go through src/lib/shopify.ts
- Cart must redirect to cart.checkoutUrl — never build checkout UI
- Never hardcode credentials — they come from .env.local
- If src/lib/shopify.ts contains mock data, run /setup-shopify to connect a real Shopify store

WORKFLOW:
- Run `npm run build` before considering any task complete
- Fix all TypeScript errors before stopping
